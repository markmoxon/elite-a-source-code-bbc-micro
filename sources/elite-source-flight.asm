\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ See STARS1 for an explanation of the maths used in this routine. The
\ calculations are as follows:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x - |x_hi| * q
\   3. y = y - |y_hi| * q
\   4. z = z + speed * 64
\
\   5. y = y - alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x + alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x - 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y + beta * 256

\    Summary: Add an orientation vector coordinate to an INWK coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)
\                         * If Y = 13, add (nosev_z_hi nosev_z_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The high byte of the result with the sign cleared (e.g.
\                       |x_hi| if X = 0, etc.)

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).
\
\ Returns:

\
\ This section sets up some vectors and calculates dot products. Specifically:

\     and we're done
\
\   * If this is a trader, 80% of the time we're done, 20% of the time the

\
\   * If this is a bounty hunter (or one of the 20% of traders) and we have been
\     really bad (i.e. a fugitive or serious offender), the ship becomes hostile
\     (if it isn't already)
\
\   * If the ship is not hostile, then either perform docking manouevres (if
\     it's docking) or fly towards the planet (if it isn't docking) and we're
\     done
\
\   * If the ship is hostile, and a pirate, and we are within the space station
\     safe zone, stop the pirate from attacking by removing all its aggression
\
\   * Calculate the dot product of the ship's nose vector (i.e. the direction it
\     is pointing) with the vector between us and the ship. This value will help

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the dot product of the vector in XX15 and one of the space station's
\ orientation vectors, as determined by the value of Y. If vect is the space
\ station orientation vector, we calculate this:
\
\   (A X) = vect . XX15
\         = vect_x * XX15 + vect_y * XX15+1 + vect_z * XX15+2
\
\ Technically speaking, this routine can also calculate the dot product between
\ XX15 and the sun's orientation vectors, as the sun and space station share the
\ same ship data slot (the second ship data block at K%). However, the sun
\ doesn't have orientation vectors, so this only gets called when that slot is
\ being used for the space station.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The space station's orientation vector:
\
\                         * If Y = 10, calculate nosev . XX15

\   Category: Flight
\    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
\ the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
\ in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
\
\ Specifically, it calculates the following:
\
\   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\ where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
\ vector for the space station.
\
\ The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
\ -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
\ way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
\ vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
\ of the station to the ship.
\
\ In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
\ actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
\
\ Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
\ the point in front of the station slot.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position
\                       (4 unit vectors from the centre of the station for each
\                       call to DCS1, so two calls will return the vector to a
\                       point that's 8 unit vectors from the centre of the

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the
\ centre, and then double the radius, draw another circle, double the radius
\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 5 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ monochrome mode 4 screen.

\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0) = (A P+1 P) / (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ The actual division here is done as an 8-bit calculation using LL31, but this
\ routine shifts both the numerator (the top part of the division) and the
\ denominator (the bottom part of the division) around to get the multi-byte
\ result we want.
\
\ Specifically, it shifts both of them to the left as far as possible, keeping a
\ tally of how many shifts get done in each one - and specifically, the
\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then
\ divides the two highest bytes with the simple 8-bit routine in LL31, and
\ shifts the result by the difference in the number of shifts, which acts as a
\ scale factor to get the correct result.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0)          The result of the division
\
\   X                   X is preserved

\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\  Deep dive: Drawing the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the first byte is the channel while the
\ second is the flush control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound,
\ while a flush control of 1 makes the sound instantly). When written in
\ hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush control, while the second is
\ the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1 and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&E0) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                The vector to normalise, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1
\
\                         * The z-coordinate in XX15+2
\
\ Returns:

\    Summary: Prepare a sound block
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Copy four sound bytes from SFX into XX16, interspersing them with null bytes,
\ with Y indicating the sound number to copy (from the values in the sound
\ table at SFX). So, for example, if we call this routine with A = 40 (long,
\ low beep), the following bytes will be set in XX16 to XX16+7:
\
\   &13 &00 &F4 &00 &0C &00 &08 &00
\
\ This block will be passed to OSWORD 7 to make the sound, which expects the
\ four sound attributes as 16-bit big-endian values - in other words, with the
\ low byte first. So the above block would pass the values &0013, &00F4, &000C
\ and &0008 to the SOUND statement when used with OSWORD 7, or:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ as the high bytes are always zero.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The sound number to copy from SFX to XX16, which is
\                       always a multiple of 8

\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the

\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)

\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the

\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various

\ Each item has four bytes of data, like this:
\
\   Byte #0 = Base price
\   Byte #1 = Economic factor in bits 0-4, with the sign in bit 7
\             Unit in bits 5-6
\   Byte #2 = Base quantity
\   Byte #3 = Mask to control price fluctuations
\
\ To make it easier for humans to follow, we've defined a macro called ITEM
\ that takes the following arguments and builds the four bytes for us:
\
\   ITEM base price, economic factor, units, base quantity, mask
\
\ So for food, we have the following:
\
\   * Base price = 19
\   * Economic factor = -2
\   * Unit = tonnes
\   * Base quantity = 6
\   * Mask = %00000001

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws the current ship on the screen. This part checks to see if
\ the ship is exploding, or if it should start exploding, and if it does it sets
\ things up accordingly.
\
\ It also does some basic checks to see if we can see the ship, and if not it
\ removes it from the screen.
\
\ In this code, XX1 is used to point to the current ship's data block at INWK
\ (the two labels are interchangeable).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX1                 XX1 shares its location with INWK, which contains the
\                       zero-page copy of the data block for this ship from the
\                       K% workspace
\
\   INF                 The address of the data block for this ship in workspace
\                       K%
\
\   XX19(1 0)           XX19(1 0) shares its location with INWK(34 33), which
\                       contains the ship line heap address pointer
\
\   XX0                 The address of the blueprint for this ship
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   EE51                Remove the current ship from the screen, called from
\                       SHPPT before drawing the ship as a point

\
\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.

\       Name: LL9 (Part 8 of 12)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Calculate the screen coordinates of visible vertices
\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section projects the coordinate of the vertex into screen coordinates and
\ stores them on the XX3 heap. By the end of this part, the XX3 heap contains
\ four bytes containing the 16-bit screen coordinates of the current vertex, in
\ the order: x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi.
\
\ When we reach here, we are looping through the vertices, and we've just worked
\ out the coordinates of the vertex in our normal coordinate system, as follows
\
\   XX15(2 0)           (x_sign x_lo) = x-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   XX15(5 3)           (y_sign y_lo) = y-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   (U T)               (z_sign z_lo) = z-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\ Note that U is always zero when we get to this point, as the vertex is always
\ in front of us (so it has a positive z-coordinate, into the screen).
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL70+1              Contains an RTS (as the first byte of an LDA
\                       instruction)

\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\
\                         * 0   = (x2, y2) on-screen
\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a point (x1, y1), a gradient and a direction of slope, move the point
\ along the line until it is on-screen, so this effectively clips the (x1, y1)

\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)

\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).

\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing

\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
