\    Summary: Print the selected system's adjective, e.g. Lavian for Lave
\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The adjective for the current system is generated by taking the system name,
\ removing the last character if it is a vowel, and adding "-ian" to the end,
\ so:
\
\   * Lave gives Lavian (as in "Lavian tree grub")
\
\   * Leesti gives Leestian (as in "Leestian Evil Juice")
\
\ This routine is called by jump token 17, {system name adjective}, and it can
\ only be used when justified text is being printed - i.e. following jump token
\ 14, {justify} - because the routine needs to use the line buffer to work.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing
\ this commentary! For the rest of us, there's a detailed explanation of all
\ this in the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling".
\
\ Arguments:
\

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\    Summary: Remove a line from the sun line heap and draw it on-screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Specifically, this does the following:
\
\   * Set X1 and X2 to the x-coordinates of the ends of the horizontal line with
\     centre YY(1 0) and length A to the left and right
\
\   * Set the Y-th byte of the LSO block to 0 (i.e. remove this line from the
\     sun line heap)
\
\   * Draw a horizontal line from (X1, Y) to (X2, Y)
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   YY(1 0)             The x-coordinate of the centre point of the line
\
\   A                   The half-width of the line, i.e. the contents of the
\                       Y-th byte of the sun line heap
\
\   Y                   The number of the entry in the sun line heap (which is
\                       also the y-coordinate of the line)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw a single segment of a circle, adding the point to the ball line heap.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   CNT                 The number of this segment
\
\   STP                 The step size for the circle
\

\
\   FLAG                Set to &FF for the first call, so it sets up the first
\                       point in the heap but waits until the second call before
\                       drawing anything (as we need two points, i.e. two calls,
\                       before we can draw a line)
\
\   K                   The circle's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             Pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the circle

\
\ Contains the four low bytes of the value 100,000,000,000 (100 billion).
\
\ The maximum number of digits that we can print with the BPRNT routine is 11,

\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).

\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit

                        \   ASCII 96-126 are defined in &C200-&C2F0 (page 2)

\    Summary: Fetch the current dashboard colours, to support flashing
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The colour to use for indicators with dangerous values
\
\   X                   The colour to use for indicators with safe values

\  Deep dive: The dashboard indicators
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The range of values shown on the indicator depends on which entry point is
\ called. For the default entry point of DILX, the range is 0-255 (as the value
\ passed in A is one byte). The other entry points are shown below.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The value to be shown on the indicator (so the larger
\                       the value, the longer the bar)

\                       from the low value colour to the high value colour. The
\                       threshold is in pixels, so it should have a value from
\                       0-16, as each bar indicator is 16 pixels wide
\
\   K                   The colour to use when A is a high value, as a 4-pixel
\                       mode 5 character row byte
\
\   K+1                 The colour to use when A is a low value, as a 4-pixel
\                       mode 5 character row byte
\
\   SC(1 0)             The screen address of the first character block in the
\                       indicator
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   DILX+2              The range of the indicator is 0-64 (for the fuel
\                       indicator)

\   DIL-1               The range of the indicator is 0-32 (for the speed
\                       indicator)
\
\   DIL                 The range of the indicator is 0-16 (for the energy

\
\ Half the time this will draw one of the four pre-defined ship hanger groups in
\ HATB, and half the time this will draw a solitary Sidewinder, Mamba, Krait or

\ around on the ground so they can face in any dirction, and larger ships are
\ drawn higher up off the ground than smaller ships.
\
\ The ships are drawn by the HAS1 routine, which uses the normal ship-drawing
\ routine in LL9, and then the hanger background is drawn by sending an OSWORD
\ 248 command to the I/O processor.

\    Summary: Draw the launch or hyperspace tunnel
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the
\ centre, and then double the radius, draw another circle, double the radius
\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 5 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ monochrome mode 4 screen.

\    Summary: Print a recursive token
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine works its way through the recursive tokens that are stored in
\ tokenised form in memory at &0400 to &06FF, and when it finds token number A,
\ it prints it. Tokens are null-terminated in memory and fill three pages,
\ but there is no lookup table as that would consume too much memory, so the
\ only way to find the correct token is to start at the beginning and look
\ through the table byte by byte, counting tokens as we go until we are in the
\ right place. This approach might not be terribly speed efficient, but it is
\ certainly memory-efficient.
\
\ For details of the tokenisation system, see variable QQ18.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The recursive token to be printed, in the range 0-148
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   TT48                Contains an RTS

\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the first byte is the channel while the
\ second is the flush control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound,
\ while a flush control of 1 makes the sound instantly). When written in
\ hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush control, while the second is
\ the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1 and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: The standard BRKV handler for the game
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine in the decryption routine at DEEOR just before the
\ game is run for the first time, and at the end of the SVE routine after the
\ disc access menu has been processed. In other words, this is the standard
\ BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MRBRK for disc access
\ operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\
\ Swap the x- and y-coordinates of all the stardust particles and draw the new
\ set of particles. Called by LOOK1 when we switch views.
\
\ This is a quick way of making the stardust field in the new view feel
\ different without having to generate a whole new field. If you look carefully
\ at the stardust field when you switch views, you can just about see that the
\ new field is a reflection of the previous field in the screen diagonal, i.e.
\ in the line from bottom left to top right. This is the line where x = y when
\ the origin is in the middle of the screen, and positive x and y are right and
\ up, which is the coordinate system we use for stardust).

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ See STARS1 for an explanation of the maths used in this routine. The
\ calculations are as follows:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x - |x_hi| * q
\   3. y = y - |y_hi| * q
\   4. z = z + speed * 64
\
\   5. y = y - alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x + alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x - 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y + beta * 256

\    Summary: Add an orientation vector coordinate to an INWK coordinate
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)
\                         * If Y = 13, add (nosev_z_hi nosev_z_lo)
\
\ Returns:

\ Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset

\    Summary: Calculate (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   Q                   Q is preserved
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   MLTU2-2             Set Q to X, so this calculates (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * X

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:

\ Another way of saying the above is this:

\   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
\
\ DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
\ are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
\ (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.

\       Name: TT102
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Keyboard
\    Summary: Process function key, save, hyperspace and chart key presses
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Process function key presses, plus "@" (save commander), "H" (hyperspace),
\ "D" (show distance to system) and "O" (move chart cursor back to current
\ system). We can also pass cursor position deltas in X and Y to indicate that
\ the cursor keys or joystick have been used (i.e. the values that are returned
\ by routine TT17).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The internal key number of the key pressed (see p.142 of
\                       the Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key
\                       numbers)
\
\   X                   The amount to move the crosshairs in the x-axis
\
\   Y                   The amount to move the crosshairs in the y-axis
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   T95                 Print the distance to the selected system

\    Summary: Move current ship: Move the ship in space according to our speed
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine has multiple stages. This stage does the following:
\
\   * Move the ship in space according to our speed (we already moved it
\     according to its own speed in part 3).
\
\ We do this by subtracting our speed (i.e. the distance we travel in this
\ iteration of the loop) from the other ship's z-coordinate. We subtract because
\ they appear to be "moving" in the opposite direction to us, and the whole
\ MVEIT routine is about moving the other ships rather than us (even though we
\ are the one doing the moving).

\ Other entry points:

\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\    Summary: Calculate (A P+2 P+1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A P+2 P+1)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following calculation, for the coordinate given by X (so this is what
\ it does for the x-coordinate):
\
\   (A P+2 P+1) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A P+2 P+1)
\
\ A is a sign bit and is not included in the calculation, but bits 0-6 of A are
\ preserved. Bit 7 is set to the sign of the result.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The sign of P(2 1) in bit 7
\
\   P(2 1)              The 16-bit value we want to add the coordinate to
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add to (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 3, add to (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\
\                         * If X = 6, add to (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The sign of the result (in bit 7)
