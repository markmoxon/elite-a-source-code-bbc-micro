\   Category: Moving
\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:

\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence

\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

                        \ do exactly the same to 64-95 and 96-125. And because

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.

\ In other words, this is the standard BRKV handler for the game, and it's
\ swapped out to MEBRK for disc access operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the

\
\ Arguments:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the

\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\   * @ toggles keyboard and Delta 14B joystick (&47)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\             Orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\   Category: Maths (Arithmetic)
\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws the current ship on the screen. This part checks to see if
\ the ship is exploding, or if it should start exploding, and if it does it sets
\ things up accordingly.
\
\ It also does some basic checks to see if we can see the ship, and if not it
\ removes it from the screen.
\
\ In this code, XX1 is used to point to the current ship's data block at INWK
\ (the two labels are interchangeable).

\
\ Arguments:

\                       K% workspace
\
\   INF                 The address of the data block for this ship in workspace
\                       K%
\
\   XX19(1 0)           XX19(1 0) shares its location with INWK(34 33), which
\                       contains the ship line heap address pointer
\
\   XX0                 The address of the blueprint for this ship

\
\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing ships
\    Summary: Draw ship: Calculate the screen coordinates of visible vertices
\  Deep dive: Drawing ships
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section projects the coordinate of the vertex into screen coordinates and
\ stores them on the XX3 heap. By the end of this part, the XX3 heap contains
\ four bytes containing the 16-bit screen coordinates of the current vertex, in
\ the order: x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi.
\
\ When we reach here, we are looping through the vertices, and we've just worked
\ out the coordinates of the vertex in our normal coordinate system, as follows
\
\   XX15(2 0)           (x_sign x_lo) = x-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   XX15(5 3)           (y_sign y_lo) = y-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\   (U T)               (z_sign z_lo) = z-coordinate of the current vertex
\
\ Note that U is always zero when we get to this point, as the vertex is always
\ in front of us (so it has a positive z-coordinate, into the screen).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL70+1              Contains an RTS (as the first byte of an LDA
\                       instruction)
\
\   LL66                A re-entry point into the ship-drawing routine, used by
\                       the LL62 routine to store 128 - (U R) on the XX3 heap

\    Summary: Clip line: Work out which end-points are on-screen, if any
\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\

\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The ERND token type, which is part of the extended token system, takes an
\ argument between 0 and 37, and returns a randomly chosen token in the range
\ specified in this table. This is used to generate the extended description of
\ each system.
\
\ For example, the entry at position 13 in this table (counting from 0) is 66,
\ so ERND 14 will expand into a random token in the range 66-70, i.e. one of
\ "JUICE", "BRANDY", "WATER", "BREW" and "GARGLE BLASTERS".

\       Name: card_pattern
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Encyclopedia
\    Summary: Layout pattern for the encyclopedia's ship cards
\  Deep dive: The Encyclopedia Galactica
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Each ship card in the encyclopedia consists of multiple sections, each of
\ which consists of one or more text labels, plus the corresponding ship data.
\ The card pattern table defines these sections and how they are laid out on
\ screen - in other words, this table contains a set of patterns, one for each
\ section, that define how to lay out that section on-screen.
\
\ Each line in the table below defines a screen position and something to print
\ there. The first two numbers are the text column and row, and the third number
\ specifies a text token from the msg_3 table (when non-zero) or the actual data
\ (when zero).
\
\ So, for example, the "cargo space" section looks like this:
\
\   EQUB  1, 12, 61
\   EQUB  1, 13, 45
\   EQUB  1, 14,  0
\
\ which defines the following layout pattern:
\
\   * Token 61 ("CARGO") at column 1, row 12
\   * Token 45 ("SPACE:") at column 1, row 13
\   * The relevant ship data (the ship's cargo capacity) at column 1, row 14
\
\ The data itself comes from the card data for the specific ship - see the table
\ at card_addr for a list of card data blocks. Each section corresponds to the
\ same section number in the card data, so the cargo space section is number 7,
\ for example.
\
\ As well as the ship data, the ship cards show the ship itself, rotating in the
\ middle of the card.
