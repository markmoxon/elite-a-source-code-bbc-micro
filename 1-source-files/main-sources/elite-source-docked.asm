\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Apply pitch and roll angles alpha and beta to the orientation vector in Y.
\
\ Specifically, this routine rotates a point (x, y, z) around the origin by
\ pitch alpha and roll beta, using the small angle approximation to make the
\ maths easier, and incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the
\ rotation more stable (though more elliptic).
\
\ If that paragraph makes sense to you, then you should probably be writing

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Swap the x- and y-coordinates of all the stardust particles and draw the new
\ set of particles. Called by LOOK1 when we switch views.
\
\ This is a quick way of making the stardust field in the new view feel
\ different without having to generate a whole new field. If you look carefully
\ at the stardust field when you switch views, you can just about see that the
\ new field is a reflection of the previous field in the screen diagonal, i.e.
\ in the line from bottom left to top right. This is the line where x = y when
\ the origin is in the middle of the screen, and positive x and y are right and
\ up, which is the coordinate system we use for stardust).

\
\ Equipment prices are stored as 10 * the actual value, so we can support prices
\ with fractions of credits (0.1 Cr). This is used for the price of fuel only.
\
\ Different ships have different equipment prices (apart from fuel which is the
\ same price for all ships). Each ship type has an offset that is used when
\ accessing this table; the offset to the price table for our current ship is
\ held in the new_costs variable, and the offset values for all the different
\ ships we can buy are defined in the new_details table.

\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence

\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

                        \
                        \ In other words, X points to the relevant page. But
                        \ what about the value of A? That gets shifted to the
                        \ left three times during the above code, which

                        \ do exactly the same to 64-95 and 96-125. And because
                        \ we also multiply this figure by 8, A now points to

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).

\
\ Returns:
\

\   Category: Ship hangar
\    Summary: Ship hangar group table
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table contains groups of ships to show in the ship hangar. A group of
\ ships is shown half the time (the other half shows a solo ship), and each of
\ the four groups is equally likely.
\
\ The bytes for each ship in the group contain the following information:
\
\   Byte #0             Non-zero = Ship type to draw
\                       0        = don't draw anything
\
\   Byte #1             Bits 0-7 = Ship's x_hi
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's z_hi (1 if clear, or 2 if set)
\
\   Byte #2             Bits 0-7 = Ship's z_lo
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's x_sign
\
\ The ship's y-coordinate is calculated in the has1 routine from the size of
\ its targetable area. Ships of type 0 are not shown.
\
\ Note that ship numbers are for the ship hangar blueprints at XX21 in the
\ docked code, rather than the full set of ships in the flight code. They are:
\
\   1 = Cargo canister
\   2 = Shuttle
\   3 = Transporter
\   4 = Cobra Mk III
\   5 = Python
\   6 = Viper
\   7 = Krait
\
\ There is one more ship blueprint in the docked code, for the Constrictor, but
\ this is only used for showing the rotating ship in the mission 1 briefing. The
\ Constrictor does not appear in the ship hangar.

\       Name: HANGER
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Ship hangar
\    Summary: Display the ship hangar
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called after the ships in the hangar have been drawn, so all
\ it has to do is draw the hangar's background.
\
\ The hangar background is made up of two parts:
\
\   * The hangar floor consists of 11 screen-wide horizontal lines, which start
\     out quite spaced out near the bottom of the screen, and bunch ever closer
\     together as the eye moves up towards the horizon, where they merge to give
\     a sense of perspective
\
\   * The back wall of the hangar consists of 15 equally spaced vertical lines
\     that join the horizon to the top of the screen
\
\ The ships in the hangar have already been drawn by this point, so the lines
\ are drawn so they don't overlap anything that's already there, which makes
\ them look like they are behind and below the ships. This is achieved by
\ drawing the lines in from the screen edges until they bump into something
\ already on-screen. For the horizontal lines, when there are multiple ships in
\ the hangar, this also means drawing lines between the ships, as well as in
\ from each side.

                        \ We start by drawing the floor

                        \ so P = 130 / Q, and as the counter Q goes from 2 to

\ The ship's position within the hangar is determined by the arguments and the

\
\   * The y-coordinate is negative and is lower down the screen for smaller
\     ships, so smaller ships are drawn closer to the ground (because they are)

\    Summary: Switch the main line-drawing routine between EOR and OR logic
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine toggles the main line-drawing routine between EOR and OR logic,
\ for use when drawing the ship hangar.
\
\ It does this by modifying the instructions in the main line-drawing routine at
\ LOIN/LL30, flipping the drawing logic between the default EOR logic (which
\ merges with whatever is already on screen, allowing us to erase anything we
\ draw for animation purposes) and OR logic (which overwrites the screen,
\ ignoring anything that's already there). We want to use OR logic for drawing
\ the ship hangar, as it looks better and we don't need to animate it).
\
\ The routine name, UNWISE, sums up this approach - if anything goes wrong, the
\ results would be messy.

\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:

\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:
\
\   P = DELTA / (the Y-th stardust particle's z_hi coordinate)
\
\   R = remainder as a fraction of A, where 1.0 = 255
\
\ Another way of saying the above is this:
\
\   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
\
\ DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
\ are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
\ (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm as TIS2, but this time we
\ keep the remainder.

\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Increase ("bump up") X by A, where X is either the current rate of pitch or
\ the current rate of roll.
\
\ The rate of pitch or roll ranges from 1 to 255 with 128 as the centre point.
\ This is the amount by which the pitch or roll is currently changing, so 1
\ means it is decreasing at the maximum rate, 128 means it is not changing,
\ and 255 means it is increasing at the maximum rate. These values correspond
\ to the line on the DC or RL indicators on the dashboard, with 1 meaning full
\ left, 128 meaning the middle, and 255 meaning full right.
\
\ If bumping up X would push it past 255, then X is set to 255.
\
\ If keyboard auto-recentre is configured and the result is less than 128, we
\ bump X up to the mid-point, 128. This is the equivalent of having a roll or
\ pitch in the left half of the indicator, when increasing the roll or pitch
\ should jump us straight to the mid-point.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clears some space at the bottom of the screen and moves the text
\ cursor to column 1, row 20.
\
\ Specifically, it zeroes the following screen locations:
\
\   &7507 to &75F0
\   &7607 to &76F0
\   &7707 to &77F0
\
\ which clears the three bottom text rows of the mode 4 screen (rows 21 to 23),

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Each indicator is a rectangle that's 3 pixels wide and 5 pixels high. If the
\ indicator is set to black, this effectively removes a missile.
\
\ Note that there are only four missile indicators on the dashboard, but in
\ Elite-A our ship can have up to 7 missiles, in which case the leftmost missile
\ indicator is used for the next missile to use, and the extra missiles are
\ implied rather than displayed.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The number of the missile indicator to update (counting
\                       from right to left and starting at 0 rather than 1, so
\                       indicator NOMSL - 1 is the leftmost indicator)
\
\   Y                   The colour of the missile indicator:
\
\                         * &00 = black (no missile)
\
\                         * &0E = red (armed and locked)
\
\                         * &E0 = yellow/white (armed)
\
\                         * &EE = green/cyan (disarmed)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\       Name: SFX
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Sound
\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the high nibble of the low byte is the flush
\ control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound, and a flush control of
\ 1 makes the sound instantly), while the low nibble of the low byte is the
\ channel number. When written in hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush
\ control, while the second is the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1
\ and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up by the loading process.

\   Category: Keyboard
\    Summary: Process function key, save key, hyperspace and chart key presses
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Process function key presses, plus "@" (save commander), "H" (hyperspace),
\ "D" (show distance to system) and "O" (move chart cursor back to current
\ system). We can also pass cursor position deltas in X and Y to indicate that
\ the cursor keys or joystick have been used (i.e. the values that are returned
\ by routine TT17).
\
\ This routine also checks for the "F" key press (search for a system), which
\ applies to enhanced versions only.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The internal key number of the key pressed (see page 142
\                       of the "Advanced User Guide for the BBC Micro" by Bray,
\                       Dickens and Holmes for a list of internal key numbers)
\
\   X                   The amount to move the crosshairs in the x-axis
\
\   Y                   The amount to move the crosshairs in the y-axis

\ so slaves and narcotics are twice as illegal as firearms. The value in FIST

\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK

\  Deep dive: Swapping between the docked and flight code
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages from the disc filing system
\ while disc access operations are being performed. When called, it makes a beep
\ and prints the system error message in the block pointed to by (&FD &FE),
\ which is where the disc filing system will put any disc errors (such as "File
\ not found", "Disc error" and so on). It then waits for a key press and returns
\ to the disc access menu.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine at the start of the SVE routine, just before the
\ disc access menu is shown, and it reverts to BRBR at the end of the SVE
\ routine after the disc access menu has been processed. In other words, BRBR is
\ the standard BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MEBRK for disc
\ access operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main difference between this routine and the standard BRKV
\ handler in BRBR is that this routine returns to the disc access menu rather
\ than restarting the game.

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We do this by dividing each of the three coordinates by the length of the
\ vector, which we can calculate using Pythagoras. Once normalised, 96 (&60) is
\ used to represent a value of 1, and 96 with bit 7 set (&E0) is used to
\ represent -1. This enables us to represent fractional values of less than 1
\ using integers.

\
\ Arguments:
\

\    Summary: Prepare a sound block
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Copy four sound bytes from SFX into XX16, interspersing them with null bytes,
\ with Y indicating the sound number to copy (from the values in the sound
\ table at SFX). So, for example, if we call this routine with A = 40 (long,
\ low beep), the following bytes will be set in XX16 to XX16+7:
\
\   &13 &00 &F4 &00 &0C &00 &08 &00
\
\ This block will be passed to OSWORD 7 to make the sound, which expects the
\ four sound attributes as 16-bit big-endian values - in other words, with the
\ low byte first. So the above block would pass the values &0013, &00F4, &000C
\ and &0008 to the SOUND statement when used with OSWORD 7, or:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ as the high bytes are always zero.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work

\       Name: LL145 (Part 1 of 4)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Clip line: Work out which end-points are on-screen, if any
\  Deep dive: Line-clipping
\             Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:
\
\                         * 0   = (x2, y2) on-screen
\
\                         * 95  = (x1, y1) on-screen,  (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                         * 191 = (x1, y1) off-screen, (x2, y2) off-screen
\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,
\                       meaning the next line sent to BLINE can't join onto the
\                       end but has to start a new segment
\
\   SWAP                The swap status of the returned coordinates:
\
\                         * &FF if we swapped the values of (x1, y1) and
\                           (x2, y2) as part of the clipping process
\
\                         * 0 if the coordinates are still in the same order
\
\   Y                   Y is preserved

\ for a system. The galaxy number is in bits 0-6, while bit 7 determines whether
\ to show this token during mission 1 only (bit 7 is clear, i.e. a value of &0x
\ in the table below), or all of the time (bit 7 is set, i.e. a value of &8x in
\ the table below).
\
\ In other words, Teorge, Arredi, Anreer and Lave have extended description
\ overrides that are always shown, while the rest only appear when mission 1 is
\ in progress.
\
\ The three variables work as follows:
\
\   * The RUPLA table contains the system numbers
\
\   * The RUGAL table contains the galaxy numbers and mission criteria
\
\   * The RUTOK table contains the extended token to display instead of the
\     normal extended description if the criteria in RUPLA and RUGAL are met
\
\ See the PDESC routine for details of how extended system descriptions work.

\    Summary: The second extended token table for recursive tokens 0-26 (DETOK3)
\  Deep dive: Extended system descriptions
\             Extended text tokens
\             The Constrictor mission
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Contains the tokens for extended description overrides of systems that match
\ the system number in RUPLA and the conditions in RUGAL.
\
\ The three variables work as follows:
\
\   * The RUPLA table contains the system numbers
\
\   * The RUGAL table contains the galaxy numbers and mission criteria
\
\   * The RUTOK table contains the extended token to display instead of the
\     normal extended description if the criteria in RUPLA and RUGAL are met
\
\ See the PDESC routine for details of how extended system descriptions work.
\
\ The encodings shown for each extended text token use the following notation:
\
\   {n}           Jump token                n = 1 to 31
\   [n?]          Random token              n = 91 to 128
\   [n]           Recursive token           n = 129 to 215
\   <n>           Two-letter token          n = 215 to 255

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The ERND token type, which is part of the extended token system, takes an
\ argument between 0 and 37, and returns a randomly chosen token in the range
\ specified in this table. This is used to generate the extended description of
\ each system.
\
\ For example, the entry at position 13 in this table (counting from 0) is 66,
\ so ERND 14 will expand into a random token in the range 66-70, i.e. one of
\ "JUICE", "BRANDY", "WATER", "BREW" and "GARGLE BLASTERS".
