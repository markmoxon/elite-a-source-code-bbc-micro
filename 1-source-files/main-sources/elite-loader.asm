\   Category: Screen mode
\    Summary: VDU commands for setting the square mode 4 screen
\  Deep dive: The split-screen mode
\             Drawing monochrome pixels in mode 4
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This block contains the bytes that get written by OSWRCH to set up the screen
\ mode (this is equivalent to using the VDU statement in BASIC).
\
\ It defines the whole screen using a square, monochrome mode 4 configuration;
\ the mode 5 part for the dashboard is implemented in the IRQ1 routine.
\
\ The top part of Elite's screen mode is based on mode 4 but with the following
\ differences:
\
\   * 32 columns, 31 rows (256 x 248 pixels) rather than 40, 32
\
\   * The horizontal sync position is at character 45 rather than 49, which
\     pushes the screen to the right (which centres it as it's not as wide as
\     the normal screen modes)
\
\   * Screen memory goes from &6000 to &7EFF, which leaves another whole page
\     for code (i.e. 256 bytes) after the end of the screen. This is where the
\     Python ship blueprint slots in
\
\   * The text window is 1 row high and 13 columns wide, and is at (2, 16)
\
\   * The cursor is disabled
\
\ This almost-square mode 4 variant makes life a lot easier when drawing to the
\ screen, as there are 256 pixels on each row (or, to put it in screen memory
\ terms, there's one page of memory per row of pixels). For more details of the
\ screen mode, see the deep dive on "Drawing monochrome pixels in mode 4".
\
\ There is also an interrupt-driven routine that switches the bytes-per-pixel
\ setting from that of mode 4 to that of mode 5, when the raster reaches the
\ split between the space view and the dashboard. See the deep dive on "The
\ split-screen mode" for details.

                        \ the number of displayed character rows to 31. For
                        \ comparison, this value is 32 for standard modes 4 and
                        \ 5, but we claw back the last row for storing code just
                        \ above the end of screen memory

 EQUB 23, 0, 12, &0C    \ Set 6845 register R12 = &0C and R13 = &00
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \

 EQUB 23, 0, 13, &00    \ to the start of screen memory in terms of character
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ rows. There are 8 pixel lines in each character row,
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ so to get the actual address of the start of screen
                        \ memory, we multiply by 8:
                        \
                        \   &0C00 * 8 = &6000
                        \

 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ This is the "horizontal displayed" register, which
                        \ defines the number of character blocks per horizontal

                        \ modes 4 and 5, but our custom screen is not as wide at
                        \ only 32 character blocks across

 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ This is the "horizontal sync position" register, which

                        \ the left-hand side of the screen. For comparison this
                        \ is 49 for modes 4 and 5, but needs to be adjusted for
                        \ our custom screen's width

 EQUB 23, 0, 10, 32     \ Set 6845 register R10 = 32
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \
 EQUB 0, 0, 0           \ This is the "cursor start" register, so this sets the

\    Summary: Palette data for space and the two dashboard colour schemes
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Palette bytes for use with the split-screen mode (see IRQ1 below for more
\ details).
\
\ Palette data is given as a set of bytes, with each byte mapping a logical
\ colour to a physical one. In each byte, the logical colour is given in bits
\ 4-7 and the physical colour in bits 0-3. See p.379 of the Advanced User Guide
\ for details of how palette mapping works, as in modes 4 and 5 we have to do
\ multiple palette commands to change the colours correctly, and the physical
\ colour value is EOR'd with 7, just to make things even more confusing.
\
\ Similarly, the palette at TVT1+16 is for the monochrome space view, where
\ logical colour 1 is mapped to physical colour 0 EOR 7 = 7 (white), and
\ logical colour 0 is mapped to physical colour 7 EOR 7 = 0 (black). Each of
\ these mappings requires six calls to SHEILA &21 - see p.379 of the Advanced
\ User Guide for an explanation.
\
\ The mode 5 palette table has two blocks which overlap. The block used depends
\ on whether or not we have an escape pod fitted. The block at TVT1 is used for
\ the standard dashboard colours, while TVT1+8 is used for the dashboard when an
\ escape pod is fitted. The colours are as follows:
\
\                 Normal (TVT1)     Escape pod (TVT1+8)
\
\   Colour 0      Black             Black
\   Colour 1      Red               Red

\
\ Contains the last saved commander data, with the name at NA% and the data at

\ (the DFS filename limit). It is terminated with a carriage return character,
\ ASCII 13.
\
\ The offset of each byte within a saved commander file is also shown as #0, #1
\ and so on, so the kill tally, for example, is in bytes #71 and #72 of the
\ saved file. The related variable name from the current commander block is
