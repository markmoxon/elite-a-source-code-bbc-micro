\    Summary: Lookup table for Tube commands sent from the parasite to the I/O
\             processor
\  Deep dive: Tube communication in Elite-A
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This table lists all the commands that can be sent from the parasite to the
\ I/O processor.
\
\ The hexadecimal number is the number of that command, and is the first byte to
\ be sent over the Tube. The parameters shown in brackets are sent next, in the
\ order shown, and if the command returns a result (denoted by a leading = sign
\ in the command name), then this is then sent back to the parasite.
\
\ Consider the following command, which scans the keyboard or Delta 14B keypad
\ for a specific flight key:
\
\   =scan_y(key_offset, delta_14b)
\
\ To run this command, the parasite would first send a value of &96 to the I/O
\ processor (using the tube_write routine), then it would send the key_offset
\ and delta_14b parameters (in that order), and finally it would wait for the
\ result to be returned by calling the tube_read routine.
\
\ Meanwhile, at the other end, the receipt of the &96 value would trigger a call
\ to the routine in WRCHV, which is the tube_wrch routine. This routine sees
\ that the received value is greater than 127, so it calls the tube_func
\ routine, which then looks up the corresponding routine from this table
\ (routine scan_y in this case) and calls it to implement the command. The
\ scan_y routine then fetches the parameter values using the tube_get routine,
\ performs the keyboard or keypad scan according to the command's parameters,
\ and finally sends the result back to the parasite using the tube_put routine.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is run when the parasite sends a write_xyc command. It writes a
\ text character to the screen at specified position. If the character is null
\ (i.e. A = 0) then it just moves the text cursor and doesn't print anything.

\    Summary: Write characters to the screen and process Tube commands from the
\             parasite
\  Deep dive: Tube communication in Elite-A
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine prints characters to the screen.
\
\ It also processes Tube commands from the parasite, because those commands are
\ sent over the Tube via FIFO 1, and Acorn's Tube host code considers arrivals
\ on FIFO 1 to be OSWRCH commands executed on the parasite, and calls the WRCHV
\ handler to implement the call. We already set WRCHV to point here in the
\ tube_elite routine, so when the I/O processor receives a byte from the
\ parasite over FIFO 1, the Tube host code calls this routine.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\

\
\   A                   The character to be printed. Can be one of the
\                       following:

\
\                         * 9 (space)
\
\                         * 10 (line feed)
\
\                         * 13 (carriage return)
\
\                         * 32 (space, but do not print anything if it's on
\                           column 17, so the disc catalogue will fit on-screen)
\
\                         * 33-126 (ASCII capital letters, numbers and
\                           punctuation)
\
\                         * 127 (delete the character to the left of the text
\                           cursor and move the cursor to the left)

\    Summary: Switch the main line-drawing routine between EOR and OR logic
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is run when the parasite sends a draw_mode command. It toggles
\ the main line-drawing routine between EOR and OR logic, for use when drawing
\ the ship hangar.
\
\ It does this by modifying the instructions in the main line-drawing routine at
\ LOIN/LL30, flipping the drawing logic between the default EOR logic (which
\ merges with whatever is already on screen, allowing us to erase anything we
\ draw for animation purposes) and OR logic (which overwrites the screen,
\ ignoring anything that's already there). We want to use OR logic for drawing
\ the ship hangar, as it looks better and we don't need to animate it).
\
\ The routine name, UNWISE, sums up this approach - if anything goes wrong, the
\ results would be messy.

                        \ above, we write %1011 in the first pass (when A = 128)
                        \ to set the right column for the side socket joystick,
                        \ and we write %0011 in the first pass (when A = 0) to

                        \
                        \ Now for the row. The low nibble of the &34 value
                        \ from b_table contains the row, so that's &4 = %0100.
